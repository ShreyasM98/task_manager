<h2> What is Angular?</h2>
<p> Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficicent and sophisticated single-page apps.</p>
<p> Angular, like other frontend frameworks, is generally used to create single-page apps that run on the client, but can be used to create full stack applications by making HTTP requests to a backend server(eg. MEAN stack).</p>
<p>Angular can be run on the server-side with something like Angular Universal.</p>
   
<h2>Why Use Angular?</h2>

   <ul>
  <li>Create dynamic frontend apps & UI's</li> 
   <li>Full featured framework(router, http, etc)</li>
   <li>Integrated TypeScript</li>
   <li>RxJS - efficient, asynchronous programming</li>
   <li>Test-friendly</li>
   <li>Popular in enterprise business</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Pre-requisites for Angular</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>JavaScript Fundamentals</li>
     <li>Async Programming</li>
     <li>Array Methods (forEach, map, filter, etc)</li>
     <li>Fetch API/ HTTP Requests</li>
     <li>NPM (Node Package Manager)</li>
   </ul>

<h2>Angular Components</h2> 
<p>Components are pieces of the UI including the template(html), logic and styling.</p>
<p>Components are reusable and can be embedded into the template as an XML-like tag.</p>

<h2>Angular Services</h2>
   <p>Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusablity.</p>

   <p>By separating a component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing, we can make our component classes lean and efficient</p>

  <p> A component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console.</p>
