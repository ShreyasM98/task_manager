1) What is Angular?

Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficicent and sophisticated single-page apps.

Angular, like other frontend frameworks, is generally used to create single-page apps that run on the client, but can be used to create full stack applications by making HTTP requests to a backend server(eg. MEAN stack).

Angular can be run on the server-side with something like Angular Universal.

2) Why Use Angular?
   Create dynamic frontend apps & UI's
   Full featured framework(router, http, etc)
   Integrated TypeScript
   RxJS - efficient, asynchronous programming
   Test-friendly
   Popular in enterprise business

3) What should you know first?
   JavaScript Fundamentals
   Async Programming
   Array Methods (forEach, map, filter, etc)
   Fetch API/ HTTP Requests
   NPM (Node Package Manager)

4) Angular Components
   Components are pieces of the UI including the template(html), logic and styling.

   Components are reusable and can be embedded into the template as an XML-like tag.

5) Angular Services
   Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusablity.

   By separating a component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing, we can make our component classes lean and efficient

   A component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console.
